### Hi there
 📃 `About me:` My name is Bruno Faria, I am Brazilian and I am currently in the Faculty of Computer Science at PUC Minas. As much as I have knowledge of some programming languages, I am not an expert in any. I manage to develop programs according to my interest, I study daily to absorb the maximum knowledge of several programming languages, since I try to be the best in the area I chose. We always have difficulties, but this makes me have the strength to seek more knowledge to improve what I need. My first contact with programming was at the age of 14, programming Discord Bots using the JavaScript language, I developed the programs out of pure interest in automating the functioning of my server, from then on I was in love with technology and programming.
